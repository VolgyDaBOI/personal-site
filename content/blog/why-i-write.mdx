# Why I Write

There's something funny about spending 10 hours writing code and then choosing to open a text editor to write words. But here we are.

I build security software for a living. Most of my day is spent thinking about how things break — auth flows, API boundaries, the thousand ways a seemingly fine system can go sideways. It's satisfying work, but it lives in private repos and internal docs that nobody will ever read.

Writing here is different. It's thinking out loud. When I try to explain something I thought I understood, I usually find out I only half-understood it. The act of writing is the act of figuring out what I actually know.

## What you'll find here

Mostly technical stuff:

- Things I learned building secure SaaS at Enclave
- Tools and workflows that actually make a difference
- Opinions about software that I'll probably regret later

Sometimes not-technical stuff. I haven't figured out the ratio yet.

## The bar

I'm not trying to write something groundbreaking every time. The bar is simple: would I have wanted to read this six months ago? If yes, ship it. If no, keep thinking.

That's it. No newsletter, no schedule, no promises. Just words when I have something worth saying.
