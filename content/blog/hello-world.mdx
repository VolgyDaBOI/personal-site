# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll share thoughts on technology, building products, and things I find interesting.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Engineering** - deep dives into tools and tech I use
- **Building** - lessons from building products
- **Life** - occasional thoughts on everything else

## A code example

Here's some TypeScript to kick things off:

```typescript
const greeting = (name: string): string => {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to my blog.`;
};

console.log(greeting("world"));
```

Stay tuned for more posts. Thanks for reading!
